## ALWB Java
This repository contains Eclipse plug-ins written in Java.  The plug-ins are used to generate Eastern Orthodox Christian liturgical texts from resource and template files.  The resource files have an extension of .ares and are key-value pairs.  The templates have an extension of .atem and written in a liturgical "programming" language.  Both types use Xtext.  The .ares and .atem files were created and are maintained by Fr. Seraphim Dedes and are available at the [AGES-Initiatives github site](https://github.com/AGES-Initiatives).
